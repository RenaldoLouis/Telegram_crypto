# Head-to-Head: Mechanical vs Claude

Total evaluated trades: 923
Cost model: 0.170% round-trip (fee 0.055% + slippage 0.030% ×2) + funding; net = gross − cost.
Every expectancy / PF below is the MANAGED trade (50% at T1, BE/+0.3R trail, rest to T2/expiry) — the same definition as unified_backtest (pinned 2026-10-08). win% is the legacy full-position win.

Quality yardstick (2026-10-21, replaced the ≥70% hit-rate bar): **net exp > 0 · net PF ≥ 1.3 · ≥ 55% of weeks green · over ≥ 30 trades**. **profitable%** (share of managed trades that closed green NET of cost) is reported, not gated. [lo–hi] = Wilson 95% CI.

## By source (gross → net of cost)

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| claude | 299 | 32.1% | **39.8% [34–45]** | -0.123 | **-0.195** | 0.67 |

## WATCH lane — promotion watch (paper-tracked, NOT in the edge book; v2 era only)

Bar to promote a watch signal into the gated EXECUTE book: **net exp > 0 · net PF ≥ 1.3 · ≥ 55% of weeks green · over ≥ 30 trades** (then still needs a manual both-direction/robustness sanity check).

## Eval engine v2 era (post-fix book — the one the quality yardstick is judged on)

n=443 v2-scored trades. Pre-fix records are not comparable.

| source | n | **net exp (R)** | net PF | weeks+ | profitable% | status vs bar |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| shadow | 437 | **-0.007** | 0.98 | 57% | 56.8% [52–61] | ✗ below bar |
| watch | 6 | **+0.374** | 3.21 | 100% | 83.3% [44–97] | ↑ clears bar, building sample (6/30) |

_Forward-sample velocity: 6 surfaced v2 trades in 36 days (1.2/week) → ~20 more weeks to n=30 at this rate._

## Verdict
**Mechanical LEADS on expectancy** (mechanical +0.011R vs claude -0.123R; n=54/299).
⚠️ CONCENTRATION: mechanical book is one-directional (short-only), 52/54 from a single signal — lead is not yet a broad edge. Do NOT flip PRIMARY_SOURCE until both directions and >1 signal have live data.

## Net-of-cost reality check
- Whole book: gross -0.032R → **net -0.085R** (PF 0.82, n=923)
- Mechanical: gross +0.011R → **net -0.048R** (n=54)
- Signal-backed: gross -0.025R → **net -0.082R** (n=81) — the only cut that should be near a real net edge
- **VERDICT: NOT DECIDABLE YET (6/30 trades)** — v2-era surfaced book (mechanical + watch; shadow excluded): n=6 trades = 6 independent bets, profitable 83.3% [44–97], net +0.374R, 95% CI of net per bet [-0.45, +1.20]R. Below 30 trades the sign of any lane is noise — including the all-era rows above.
